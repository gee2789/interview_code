# Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:
#
# The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock.
# A higher index indicates a later time.
# So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am and $550 at 11:00am, then:
#
# stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500
#
# Write an efficient function that takes stock_prices_yesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.
#
# For example:
#
#   stock_prices_yesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]
#
# get_max_profit(stock_prices_yesterday)
# # returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)
#
# No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).

# Brute Force Steps
# 1. Set sample array
# 2. Take the first number subtract it against all subsequent numbers

  # Create a hash of {number: profit} // {10:5, 7:2, 5:0, 8:0, 11:2, 9:0} Don't forget you can't go backwards.
  # use the each_with_index.map iterator to work through this
# require 'pry'
#
#   array = [10, 1, 2, 5, 7, 11]
#   profit_hash = Hash.new
#   count = 0
#
#   until count = array.length
#     profit_array = []
#     current_number = array[count]
#
#     array.map do |number|
#       profit = current_number - array[count+1]
#       profit_array.push(profit)
#     end
#
#     max_profit = profit_array.max
#     profit_hash[array[count]] = max_profit
#     count += 1
#   end
#
#   print count
#   print profit_hash
